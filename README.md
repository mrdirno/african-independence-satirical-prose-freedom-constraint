## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a newly independent ministry must use the colonial rulebook to justify breaking a colonial rule.
- Create the minutes from the 'Committee on National Symbol Acclimatization' debating why the imported national bird seems depressed.
- Draft a series of increasingly frantic internal memos from the 'Department of Temporal Integrity' as all the new nation's clocks begin to show different, but equally symbolic, wrong times.
- Write a monologue from the perspective of the Independence Arch itself, observing the chaotic parade and the weight of expectation.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Ceremonial Clock Simulator' that visually and audibly breaks down in artistically symbolic ways based on user-inputted political or social stressors.
- Create a generative text tool that produces satirical government memos and committee reports based on themes of bureaucratic paradox and post-colonial constraint.
