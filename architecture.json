Dramatic, golden-hour sunlight with long, stark shadows cuts through the dust-filled air, casting a warm, hopeful glow on the scene below, color palette of colonial faded pastels clashing with vibrant African wax-print hues and lush greens, [Lighting & Color Palette]. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev, [Quality & Technical Enforcers]."
